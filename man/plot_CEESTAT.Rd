\title{Plot a horizontal stacked bar chart for review assessments}
\usage{
plot_CEESTAT(
  df,
  palette = c(Gold = "#b28800", Green = "#00a651", Amber = "#f7931e", Red = "#c1272d",
    NA_ = "#fbe8b5")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame with one column \code{Question} (character) and additional columns for each
appraisal category (e.g., \code{Gold}, \code{Green}, \code{Amber}, \code{Red}, \code{NA_}), all numeric.}

\item{palette}{A named vector of colors for each appraisal category. Defaults to a standard
color set used in systematic review plots.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the horizontal stacked bar chart.
}
\description{
This function creates a horizontal stacked bar chart (like the one used in systematic review. It is designed to visualize categorical
appraisal CEESTAT results (e.g., Gold, Green, Amber, Red, N/A) across multiple review criteria.
